# Getting Started

**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Prequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Node.js and npm (or Yarn).
- You have installed the React Native CLI.
- You have an Android or iOS development environment set up:
  - [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

# using npm

npm start

# OR using Yarn

yarn start

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

### For Android

### using npm

npm run android

### OR using Yarn

yarn android

# For iOS

### using npm

npm run ios

### OR using Yarn

yarn ios

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations!

You've successfully run Asset Tracker
